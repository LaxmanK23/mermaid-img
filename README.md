# Mermaid Flowchart Generator

This project generates a flowchart from Mermaid code using the Mermaid CLI and Python script. The flowchart is saved as an image (e.g., PNG).

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Mermaid CLI

You need to install the [Mermaid CLI](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli) globally via `npm`. This tool converts Mermaid code into flowchart images.

Run the following command to install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli


now you can run

python main.py

your flowchart will be generated.

```
